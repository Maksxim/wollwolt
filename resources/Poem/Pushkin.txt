Near the seaside there is a green oak;
Golden chain on an oak tree:
And day and night the cat is a scientist
Everything goes round and round in a chain;
Goes to the right - the song starts,
To the left - he tells a fairy tale.
There are miracles: the goblin roams there,
The mermaid sits on the branches;
There on unknown paths
Traces of unseen beasts;
Hut there on chicken legs
Stands without windows, without doors;
There the forest and valleys of visions are full;
There, at dawn, waves will come
On the sandy and empty shore,
And thirty beautiful knights
A series of clear waters emerge,
And with them their uncle is sea;
There is a queen in passing
Captivates the formidable king;
There in the clouds before the people
Through the forests, through the seas
The sorcerer carries the hero;
In the dungeon there the princess is grieving,
And the brown wolf faithfully serves her;
There is a stupa with Baba Yaga
It goes, wanders by itself,
There, King Kashchei languishes over gold;
There is a Russian spirit ... there it smells of Russia!
And there I was, and I drank honey;
I saw a green oak by the sea;
Sitting under it, and the cat is a scientist
He told me his stories.
